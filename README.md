# crisis_mapping_flood
This code provides methodology for preparing flood hazard maps in a replicable way, particularly for the coastal cities where floods pose a recurrent danger because of climate change and its impact on sea level rise. Taking San Francisco, California as an example and using OpenStreetMap data from OSMnx Python Package, this code compiles a crisis map that indicates hazard prone areas for evacuation management.
